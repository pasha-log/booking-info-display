## WordPress Booking Info Display Plugin
**Description**
The WP Booking Calendar plugin failed to provide crucial details for a family of 30+ members sharing a propertyâ€”specifically, who booked which dates. Developed a custom plugin: Ran SQL queries to retrieve family members' names for relevant dates (current year and beyond). Displayed this information in a responsive table alongside the booking form.

**Technologies Used:**
- PHP
- CSS
- HTML
